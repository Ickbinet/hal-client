# HAL Client

HAL Client can be used to try out [HAL](https://stateless.group/hal_specification.html) and [HAL-FORMS](https://rwcbook.github.io/hal-forms/) APIs.

- Supported response content types are: application/prs.hal-forms+json,
  application/hal+json and application/json. All other types are displayed in a
  sandboxed iframe.

- HAL-FORMS are supported for content types application/json,
  application/x-www-form-urlencoded and multipart/form-data.

- The app is created with plain HTML/CSS/ES, no frameworks, no build.

- Manually tested (clicked through) against:
  <https://rwcbook08.herokuapp.com/task/> and
  <https://hypermedia-movies-demo.herokuapp.com/api>. Thanks to Mike Amundsen
  and Kai TÃ¶dter for providing these example apps.
